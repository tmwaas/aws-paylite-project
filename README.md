# PayLite - Cloud-Native Payment & Risk Scoring Platform

## 📌 Overview

PayLite is a **cloud-native, microservices-based payment processing and risk scoring platform** designed for high availability, scalability, and security. It leverages **AWS services**, **Terraform infrastructure as code (IaC)**, and **containerized microservices** to provide a production-ready environment.

This repository contains both the **application services** (e.g., payments API, risk scorer) and the **infrastructure code** (Terraform modules and environment definitions).

## 🚀 Features

* **Payments API** – A RESTful API for processing and managing payments.
* **Risk Scorer Service** – Evaluates transactions in real-time using scoring logic.
* **Terraform Infrastructure** – Automated provisioning of VPC, ECS/EKS clusters, load balancers, and WAF.
* **Microservices Architecture** – Each service runs in an isolated container for modularity and scalability.
* **AWS Native Integration** – Built on AWS ECS Fargate, EKS, and WAF for managed scalability and security.
* **CI/CD Ready** – Easily integrated into pipelines for continuous delivery and deployments.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/tmw-paylite-extended.git
cd tmw-paylite-extended
```

### 2. Infrastructure Deployment (Terraform)

Make sure you have [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) and [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/) configured.

```bash
cd infra/envs/prod-demo
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

This will provision the required AWS resources such as VPC, ECS/EKS clusters, ALB, and WAF.

### 3. Build & Deploy Microservices

Each service has a Dockerfile. For example, to build and run the **Payments API** locally:

```bash
cd services/payments-api
docker build -t payments-api .
docker run -p 8080:8080 payments-api
```

For AWS deployment, push the images to **ECR** and update ECS/EKS task definitions accordingly.

### 4. Access the Services

Once deployed, services will be accessible via the **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** endpoint created by Terraform:

```
https://<alb-dns-or-domain>/payments
https://<alb-dns-or-domain>/risk
```
